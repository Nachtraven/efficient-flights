# Efficient flights
Coding challenge for a redacted employer

Total coding + Learning time: 25 hours


# To launch: 

### Navigate to folder containing files

### Compile with "scalac *.scala"

### Run with "scala -J-Xmx2g -J-Xss1024m quantexa"

Output is in 4 parts: 1, 2, 3, 4/bonus (Q4 and Bonus are idential, Q4 not included as it causes a memory overflows)
Each question class outputs its own result

Ran with extra memory due to the limitations of using scala, spark would definitely be more appropriate for Q4/Bonus and would have allowed q4 to be fully printed/shown. Better optimisation of 4/Bonus helps but doesn't eliminate the need for extra memory.
