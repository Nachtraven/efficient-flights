# Quantexa
Coding challenge for quantexa

Total coding + Learning time: 25 hours


# To launch: 

### Navigate to folder containing files

### Compile with "scalac *.scala"

### Run with "scala -J-Xmx2g -J-Xss1024m quantexa"

Output is in 4 parts: 1, 2, 3, 4/bonus (Q4 and Bonus are nearly idential, Q4 not included as it causes a memory overflow due to the amount to print)
Each question class outputs its own result

Ran with extra memory due to the limitations of using scala, spark would definitely be more appropriate for Q4/Bonus and would have allowed q4 to be fully printed/shown
